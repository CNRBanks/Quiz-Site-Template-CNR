# Quiz-Site-Template-CNR

## Description

My goal was to create a quiz template that users could easily update with their own questions and time frame.
This site allows users to take a quiz within a given time limit and record their score upon completion.

## Usage

Users can start the quiz and read the terms of the quiz. Once they begin the quiz the timer will start and they will have the option to select an answer for each question. Once the quiz has been completed the user can record their information, end the quiz, or retake the quiz.
